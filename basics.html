<h4>There are many formats for records to come in, here is a quick list of the differences between them.</h4>
<HR COLOR="#aaa8a1" WIDTH="60%" NOSHADE>
<OL>
<li>45s- Also Known as 7 inches.  They usually contain a single track on both sides of the disc.  Most 45s have a larger spindle hole and will take a small circular adaptor to play.  The smaller records spin at 45 rotations a minute, hence their name.</li>	

<br>
<li>12 inch Records-  This format is similar to a 45 in the fact they usually contain singles and not whole albums. You can usually find remixes of songs on 12 inch records.  This format is great for DJing and record scratching.</li>
<br>
<li>12 inch long play (LPs)- This format is the standard and usually what you think of when it comes to records.  This format contains whole albums hence the name long play.</li>
<br>
<li>180 gram 12 LP- These are heavy weight pressing of records, usually reissues, that weigh 180 grams.  With this you get a sturdy and structurally soundrecord that makes for great pressing and audiophile quality sound </li>
<br>
<LI>78s-78s were the first format of records to come out.  They were shallaced, heavy and brittle. Because of that, they use a different needle to play.  Do not play them on your standard record player.  The format came out early in the 20th century and a nation was hooked on being able to enjoy music at home. </LI>
