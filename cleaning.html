<p>Before you get started, here is what you need</p>
<ul style="font-family: Book Antiqua">
  <li>1 large bath towel</li>
  <li>3 microfiber cloths</li>
  <li>1 hand towel</li>
  <li>Paper towels</li>
  <li>Dawn Dish Soap</li>
  <li>Windex</li>
  <li>Simply Green Cleaner</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Sink or Wash Tub</li>
  <li>Bright light</li>
</ul> 
<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by Step</h2>
<h4>
Prep by laying out a large bath towel on the floor or chosen surface.  This will act as your drying station<br><br>

1. Remove the record from the sleeve. Place sleeve in a safe location.<br><br>
2. Take the record over to a bight light source and inspect it.  Don't keep the record too close a heat source or it will being to warp and melt.<br><br>
3. Using one of the microfiber towels wipe down the record, following its grooves to clear off any loose dust and dirty.  Shake the cloth out afterwards<br><br>
4. Take the record to a sink or water source<br><br>
5. Gentle wet one of the microfiber cloths with luke warm water and a dime size amount of Dawn dish soap. Work to lather. Please note, hot water can warp a record.<br><br>
6. Gently and firmly start cleaning your record with the soapy dish cloth.  Follow the circular grooves while cleaning in a left or right motion.  Be sure to have a good grip on your record, if you feel safer cleaning it on your flat towel, please do so.  Try to avoid the paper label, if it does get wet and start to bubble, don't touch it.  Let it dry and in most case the label reverts back to its original state.<br><br>
7. Rise both sides of your record getting all soap off it.  Gently dry it off with the hand towel<br><br>
8. Take the other microfiber cloth and spray it with Windex.  Saturate the cloth, but stop before it starts to drip. Wipe down both sides of the record following the grooves in a left or right motion. Let both sides dry clear. AVOID THE LABEL WHEN USING WINDEX. Gently dry it off with the hand towel<br><br>
9. Take the unused microfiber cloth and saturate it with just water and ring it out.  Give a final wipe down to both side of the record to get any Windex remaining on the record off.  Gently dry it off with the hand towel afterwards<br><br>
10. Place on the large bath towel to air dry. Let the record dry for 3 hours before playing. Be sure to flip the record every half hour so labels and records dry evenly.  Again, if the label is bubbling up because it got wet, keep that side up and it should deflate and look normal once it dries.<br><br>
11. For dirty sleeves, spray some Simple Green cleaner on paper towel and rub gently over both sides.  This will help remove some stains and dirt.  Please use caution, if your sleeve is has a matte mache feel do not clean it, it will be too fragile.  Also, stop if you see a lot of ink transferring to your paper towel, you are rubbing off the art work, not the dirt.<br><br>
12. Feel free to play your newly cleaned record!
