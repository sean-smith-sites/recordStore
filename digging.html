<h2>Grading a Record</h2>
<h4 >Record sellers have developed a grading scale over the years to express the condition the record is in.  The grading is broken down into 2 parts, the record and the sleeve (art work).  Since many records are bought online, it is good to know what the grading short hand actually means.  Grading indiciates how well you record will play and sound. Either piece, can be separately graded. More information be found<a href="http://www.recordcollectorsguild.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=17&page=1"> here</a> and <a href="http://www.ebay.com/gds/Quick-Grading-Guide-Goldmine-Grading-Standard-NM-VG-VG-/10000000001130874/g.html">here</a>. </h4>

<li>M- M is for short for Mint.  This is as prestine a condition a record can come and should not be used very often.  Even carefully cared for records don&#39;t usually qualify for this grade.</li> 
<br>
<li>EX- Excellent records are in almost perfect shape.  Excellent condition records will play perfect.  Sleeves should show no signs of wear.  A record might have light paper scuffs but no audible scratches or defects</li>
<br>
<li>VG- Very Good Condition is the most common condition you will see used records in.  Very Good Condition incompasses normal wear of a well taken care of record.  There might be surface scuffs or light fuzz sound in the quiet parts of the record.  Sleevs might show ring wear from where the record sits in it or have nixs and slight bends </li>
<br>
<li>F- Fair condition of records are a bit rough around the edges.  They may play rough or even skip.  The record will prabably play with pops and hisses. Sleeves may be split at the seams or bent.  The artwork will likely be comprised in someway </li>
<br>
<LI>G-Good record should usually be avoided.  They are usually used at placeholders in someone&#39;s collection and should not be played.  Good condition records could damage your needle.  If you buy a "good" condition record, expect a rough play with skips from scratches. </LI>

<h2>Tips for D.I.T.C.</h2>
<h4>So you finally decided to go digging in the crates in the wild.  First things first, where should I go?  One of the best things about having a record player and building your collection is finding your favorite old albums, forgotten obscure gems and rare, pricey finds for dirt cheap.  Digging in the crates can be messy, fun and rewarding if you are patience.  Look up the value of your new find at the premier vinyl market place at <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a>.</h4>


<h2>So Where Should I Go?</h2>
<p>Thrift Stores -are a great option.  There is a ton of new merchandise arriving all the time.  I have personally found some of my greatest find there including some very pricey records I got for pennies on the dollar of their actual worth.  You will find a ton of junk and “old people music“ but if you visit Thrift Store at a frequent pace, you imporve your chances of finding something amazing. Check out this on going thread for epic <a href="http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/ultimate-thrift-store-record-find.277460/">thrift store</a> finds.</p>

<p>Local Junk Stores -are another prime vinyl picking place.  Think of that dingy store, filled with random oddities, usually with nothing actually priced and you are envisioning the right type of store.  These places buy cheap and sell cheap and usually don’t know what they have record wise.  A couple tips, buying in bulk helps with prices and don’t be afraid to get messy.  I’ve looked in some of the dustiest basement’s I’ve ever seen hunting for treasure and found gold.  You just got to work for it.</p>

<p>Estate and Garage Sales- Estate sales are an amazing place to look for records, because they are usually priced to move by a 3rd party.  This avoids people’s attachment to their collection and inflating the price due to nostalgia and personal taste.  I’ve walked out of estate sales with hundreds of records for 30 bucks, only to find the collection was worth a hundreds upon researching.  Garage sales are a lot like thrift stores, you will have to sift through a lot of junk, but go to enough and you’re bound to find something amazing.</p>
<h2>Places To Avoid</h2>

<p>Antique Stores and Big City Flea Markets- Antique Stores are some of my least favorite places to look for records.  Prices are too high and all over the place.  No, your Glen Miller Band record isn’t worth 20 dollars just because it’s old. No, your classic rock staple shouldn’t be over 10 dollars because they are a dime a dozen and millions of copies where pressed back then.  There are rarely deals to be had in Antique Stores.  As a general rule for record collecting, avoid where the hipster can be found abundantly.  You don&#39;t want to try to pick gems with the cool kids, because usually, they are in the know.  Nothing brings out vinyl loving hipster more than a Flea Market in a Big City.  The competition is stiff, their knowledge is deep and sellers usually know what they have and their audience, so prices are usually at value for most.</p>
